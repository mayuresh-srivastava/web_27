# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Postcode.create(pstcode: '122001', address:'3563, Sector 23', city: 'gurgaon', state: 'haryana', country: 'india')
#  Postcode.create(pstcode: '122002', address:'4502B, Sector 32A', city: 'noida', state: 'uttar pradesh', country: 'ind')
#  Postcode.create(pstcode: '122003', address:'5, M.G. Road', city: 'gurugram', state: 'haryan', country: 'indi')
